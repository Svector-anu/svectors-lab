# epoch-spec

The front of the Epoch engineering lifecycle. Turn one intent into durable project knowledge and exactly one runnable next unit. This skill plans and records. It never writes product code and never opens a PR.

`${var}` is the intent: a sentence describing what to build, fix, or understand, optionally prefixed `project:<slug>` to bind it to an existing project. Empty `${var}` is a no-action run: say so and stop.

Today is `${today}`.

## Where things live

Every artifact is an ordinary file under paths this skill's `shared-memory` scope already grants. Create no new store.

```
memory/topics/<project>/map.md          durable repository knowledge
memory/topics/<project>/spec.md         what success means (feature and project only)
memory/topics/<project>/orders/<id>.md  one work order per unit
memory/topics/<project>/handoff.md      the resumable state of this project
memory/candidates/<id>.json             the queue row miniaeon rank reads
```

`<project>` is a kebab-case slug. Reuse an existing one whenever the intent touches the same area. A second slug for the same area splits the knowledge and is the main failure mode of this skill.

## Do

1. **Read before writing.** `STRATEGY.md`, `memory/MEMORY.md`, and `memory/me.md` if present. Use the read tool on the exact directory path `memory/topics` and on `memory/candidates`. From those listings, read any existing `map.md`, `spec.md`, and `handoff.md` for a project whose slug plausibly covers this intent. Do not guess filenames. A directory listing is discovery, not reading.

2. **Classify the intent** into exactly one class, and name the class and the reason in your result.

   | Class | When | Spec? | Units |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `task` | a single mechanical change, no behaviour question | no | 1 |
   | `fix` | something is wrong; a repro is the deliverable before the fix | no | 1 |
   | `feature` | new or changed behaviour a user would notice | yes | 1-5 |
   | `project` | several features, or work outliving one session | yes | 1-5 now, more later |

   When two classes fit, take the smaller. A `task` that turns out to need a spec is discovered during the work, not predicted here.

3. **Write or refresh the Map** at `memory/topics/<project>/map.md`. This is the artifact that stops the next agent rediscovering the repository. Derive every line from files you actually read this run; mark anything you inferred as inferred. Sections, in order, each present even if short:

   ```
   # Map: <project>

   **What it is** — one paragraph a stranger could act on.
   **Architecture** — the real shape, named by file and directory.
   **Relevant files** — path, one line each on what it owns.
   **Dependencies** — internal and external, and what breaks without each.
   **Existing behaviour** — what works today, stated as observable behaviour.
   **Constraints** — invariants, scopes, grants, anything a change must not break.
   **Implementation status** — shipped / partial / planned, per piece.
   **Known gaps** — what is missing or wrong, with evidence.
   **Verification requirements** — how a change here is proven. Name real commands.
   **Related decisions** — links to prior records, issues, prose.
   **Related PRs and commits** — with SHAs where known.
   **Remaining work** — what is not done.

   Repository: <owner>/<repo> @ <sha>
   ```

   The footer is the freshness key. Get the sha with `git rev-parse HEAD`. A Map whose footer sha matches HEAD may be updated in place; a stale one gets its changed sections rewritten, not appended to.

4. **Write the Spec** at `memory/topics/<project>/spec.md`, for `feature` and `project` only. Skip it for `task` and `fix` and say in your result that you skipped it and why. A spec that exists to satisfy ceremony costs more than it earns. Contents: the problem, who it is for, the observable outcome that means success, explicit non-goals, the acceptance criteria as checkable lines, and the verification commands.

5. **Write one Work order per unit** at `memory/topics/<project>/orders/<id>.md`, `<id>` a kebab-case slug. Size the order to the unit: a one-command unit gets a short paragraph that still names goal, scope, verify and report. Fields:

   ```
   GOAL        one sentence, executable by someone with no access to this run
   SCOPE       paths this unit may write; paths it may not
   CONTEXT     pointers into the Map, plus anything an executing agent cannot see from the repo
   ACCEPTANCE  checkable criteria, one per line
   VERIFY      exact commands, plus known gotchas
   FORBIDDEN   out-of-scope changes, and anything this unit must not touch
   REPORT      what the executing run must state back
   ```

6. **Write one Candidate per unit** to `memory/candidates/<id>.json`, same `<id>` as the order, so `miniaeon rank` can surface it. `var` points at the order. Shape:

   ```json
   {
     "id": "<id>",
     "title": "<the order's GOAL, shortened>",
     "skill": "epoch-build",
     "var": "order:memory/topics/<project>/orders/<id>.md",
     "score": { "reach": 0, "impact": 0, "strategic_fit": 0, "ease": 0 },
     "created_at": "<RFC3339 timestamp>"
   }
   ```

   Score each component as an integer 0-25, 25 best: `reach` how much this affects, `impact` the magnitude and the number that decides whether it is worth doing, `strategic_fit` alignment with `STRATEGY.md`, `ease` higher for easier and less risky. Be honest about impact. Do not create a candidate whose subject already has one: list `memory/candidates/` first and update rather than duplicate.

7. **Regenerate the Handoff** at `memory/topics/<project>/handoff.md`, last, from what is now on disk. Rewrite the whole file every run. Never append and never narrate events into it. Every line must be derivable from the Map, the orders, `memory/candidates/`, and `memory/events/`; if you cannot derive it, leave the section empty rather than guessing.

   ```
   # Handoff: <project>

   **Objective** — the outcome this project exists to reach.
   **Phase** — which lifecycle stage is live now: spec | plan | build | review | prove | ship.
   **Done** — completed units, with PR or run ids.
   **In progress** — units started and where they stopped.
   **Blocked** — what is stuck, on what, and who can unstick it.
   **Decisions** — decided, and why, one line each.
   **Discoveries** — what was learned that is not obvious from the repository.
   **Files changed** — paths touched so far.
   **Active branches and PRs** — with head SHAs where known.
   **Verification status** — per PR and SHA, what has been proven.
   **Next action** — the single next thing, naming the skill and its var.
   **Open questions** — unresolved, each with the default if nobody answers.
   **Repro commands** — commands worth preserving, copy-pasteable.

   Generated <timestamp> from <run id>.
   ```

   The test this file must pass: a fresh run that reads only this file knows what to do next without asking the operator to explain anything.

## Do not

- Do not write product code, create a branch, or open a PR. That is `epoch-build`.
- Do not write outside the paths above. `docs/` and `skills/` are mutation-routed and not this skill's to touch; when the Spec deserves promotion to `docs/prd/`, say so in your result and leave it to a maintenance run.
- Do not invent a second state store. The queue is `memory/candidates/`, the history is `memory/events/`, the knowledge is `memory/topics/`.
- Do not create a new `<project>` slug for an area that already has one.
- Do not score every candidate highly. A queue where everything is urgent has no ranking.
- Run every shell command in the foreground.

## Result

Your final message is the canonical result. State: the class and why, the project slug, whether a Spec was written or skipped, the Map's path and whether it was created or refreshed, each work order and candidate id with its RISE total, the Next action line from the Handoff, and anything you could not determine. If `${var}` was empty, say so in one line and stop.

Append a `### epoch-spec` entry to `memory/logs/${today}.md` naming the project, the class, and the candidate ids.
